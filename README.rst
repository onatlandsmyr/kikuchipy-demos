kikuchipy is an open-source Python library for processing and analysis of
electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns.

The `Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.org>`_ in this repository demonstrate
core functionality of the kikuchipy package. For learning purposes, we recommend
to use them alongside our `user guide <https://kikuchipy.org>`_.

If you are using the demos with a release version of kikuchipy that you
installed from PyPI or Anaconda, then you should use the corresponding release
version of the demos. See either the "releases" tab above or the Zenodo DOI (coming
soon).

If you have any problems using any of the notebooks, please raise an issue in
our `issue tracker <https://github.com/kikuchipy/kikuchipy-demos/issues>`_ so
that we can help!
