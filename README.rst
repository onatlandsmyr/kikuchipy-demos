kikuchipy is an open-source Python library for processing and analysis of
electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns.

The `Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org>`_ in this repository demonstrate
core functionality of the kikuchipy package. For learning purposes, we recommend
to use them alongside our `user guide <https://kikuchipy.org>`_.
